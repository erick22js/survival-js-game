# survival-js-game
Try for a little wild adventure in this old prototype of a survival game idea, with a terrible code but a cool mechanic, i liked it

You can try the live demo in: http://erick22.rf.gd/survival-project/main/

# mechanics
- Move the character with WASD
- Gather resource with numpad Del
- Sleeps with Z
- Drops items with Q
- Picks dropped items with P
- Cheated block selection with E
- Cheated block insertion with numpad 0

Now the crafts recipes i can't help much, you must discover them :Â´-)
Good luck!
